# social-media-scrapper
Social media scrapper allowes you to call couple of twitter endpoints, to get list of followers or likes for any user. As well as couple of twitch endpoints to get details about a user, concurent views for a user or list of followers/fallowings.

## Run app
There are three weys you could use the app

* To run locally, first clone the project, then run following commands
```
go mod download
go mod verify
go run .
```
* To run via docker container, clone the project and then run `docker compose up` this will use docker files (dockerfile and docker-compose) to create an image and a container. Then you will be able to call apis.

* Finaly you could just click the following [link](https://fly-sms.fly.dev/swagger/index.html) which will take you to the api swagger page. From there you will be able to use any endpoint. I deployed docker image of the app on [fly](https://fly.io), it's a heroku alternative since latter doesn't have free tier anymore.

***Note:** in first two approaches you will have to add 'api token' in order to get any results from the api*

## Swagger
If you are running app locally, and want to use swagger, first you will need to initialize documentation files by running `swag init`. Now you can run the app and navigate to `localhost:port/swagger/index.html` (default port=40080) and use api from there. [More about swag.](https://github.com/swaggo/swag)

## Developer notes
### Twitter
* To get data from twitter api I decidet to use [go-twitterV2](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/g8rswimmer/go-twitter/v2@v2.1.5) library. It is easy to use and it had even more functionality than I needed at this time. v2 of the library is new so changes or even breaking changes could cause problems in the future on the outher hand it save development time right now.
* In order to make using api as easy as possible I decided to implement authentication middleware. From users perspective, it is easier to copy some username from twitter and not wory about ids but most of the endpoints want to receive id instead of username. There's where the middleware comes in handy, for every twitter request it takse username input, validates it and sends coresponding id to other layers.
### Twitch
* I didn't find any good library for twitch, so I wrote a small client, with just the requests that were necessary for this demo. Client is easy to extend and could have any matching request to twitch api.
### Possible improvements
* Make http error models for better error handling and more meaningful messages.
* Extend authentication middleware to cover twitch endpoints as well.
* Add db for cashing users.
